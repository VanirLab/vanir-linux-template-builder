- Move template flavors into own directories so scripts_dir wont be polluted
  ../scripts_flavors/wheezy-whonix-gateway/

  ../${TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_DIR}/${TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_PREFIX}[-]whonix-gateway/

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Make flavor directory have $DIST in name - to prevent it from bwing built
#   incorrectly
# - Configuration option to choose alternate location of flavor directory 
# - Configuration option to use custom $DIST- prefix  (for generic flavors)
# - Take into consideration that multiple templates will build at once so we 
#   need to set a custom prefix like this:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# - Would use the prefix of 'debian' which would allow same script to be used for
#   all 'debian' based builds, or it could have been set as 
#   'wheezy+whonix-gateway;' to use a script destined for any distro
TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_PREFIX = wheezy+whonix-gateway;debian \
                         wheezy+whonix-workstation;debian

# Alternate location for template flavor scripts
TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_DIR = wheezy+whonix-gateway;/home/user/whonix/gateway \
                      wheezy+whonix-workstation;/home/usr/whonix/workstation

- allow access to multiple flavor options .. say gnome for whonix-workstation
  wheezy+whonix-workstation+gnome+more

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - TEMPLATE_OPTIONS will be iterated and each entry treated as if it was its 
#   own flavor, but to override you must include base flavor name:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Would use same FLAVOR for all distros for whonix-workstation+gnome
TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_PREFIX = wheezy+whonix-workstation+gnome;

# - Template Flavors are in /home/user/whoix/gnome for wheezy+whonix-workstation+gnome
# - DISTS_VM is still lists all OPTIONAL flavors though
TEMPLATE_FLAVOR_DIR = wheezy+whonix-workstation+gnome;/home/usr/whonix/gnome
